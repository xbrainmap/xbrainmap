    This is the top level function to infer the position (and eventually size) of all cells in a 3D 
    volume of image data. We assume that we already have computed a "probability map" which encodes 
    the probability that each voxel corresponds to a cell body.
    
    Parameters 
    ----------
    cell_probability : ndarray
        Nr x Nc x Nz matrix which contains the probability of each voxel being a cell body. 
    
    probability_threshold : float
        threshold between (0,1) to apply to probability map (only consider voxels for which 
        cell_probability(r,c,z) > probability_threshold)
    stopping_criterion : float
        stopping criterion is a value between (0,1) (minimum normalized correlation between 
        template and probability map) (Example = 0.47)
    initial_template_size : int
        initial size of spherical template (to use in sweep)
    dilation_size : int
        size to increase mask around each detected cell (zero out sphere of radius with 
        initial_template_size+dilation_size around each centroid)
    max_no_cells : int
        maximum number of cells (alternative stopping criterion)
        
    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        centroids = D x 4 matrix, where D = number of detected cells.
        The (x,y,z) coordinate of each cell are in columns 1-3.
        The fourth column contains the correlation (ptest) between the template
        and probability map and thus represents our "confidence" in the estimate.
        The algorithm terminates when ptest<=stopping_criterion.
