What is needed to execute this code:

Need two different python environments to run this code:

One: python Environment to run Ilastik code and below is how to do it (Ilastik is for PY 2)


conda create -n ilastik-dev  python=2.7
source activate ilastik-dev
conda install -c ilastik ilastik-everything-but-tracking
pip install mahotas
pip install ndparse
conda install ipython
conda install jupyter
source deactivate
source activate ilastik-dev

Two: python Environment with parallel HDF enabled
William Scullin helped me build PHDF.  Do the following for PHDF - THIS IS FOR PYTHON 3.5 Ð NOT PYTHON 2.7
It IS for MAC


conda install -c mehditon hdf5
conda install -c mehditon h5py
conda install -c mehditon mpi4py
