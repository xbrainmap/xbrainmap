This repository contains methods for analyzing and quantifying neuroanatomy in X-ray micro tomography images. 
You can find further details about how we apply the methods in this repo to analyze mm-scale brain volumes in the following paper:

Dyer, Eva L., et al. "Quantifying mesoscale neuroanatomy using X-ray microtomography."
