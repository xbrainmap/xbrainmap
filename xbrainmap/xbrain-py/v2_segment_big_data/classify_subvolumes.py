    Assigns each pixels to the class with the highest probability value determined by Ilastik classifier.
    
    Ilastik returns probability map in the "exported_data" dataset with the dimensions of x,y,z 
    (pixel location) by N values and N is the number of classes (labels) defined in the Ilastik 
    trained data file. This script adds N datasets to each of the input hdf5 files. Dimension of
    each dataset is x,y,z (pixel location) and value of zero or one. The pixel location in the added
    datasets with the highest probability value is one, zero otherwise.
    
    Input: Ilastik sub-volumes pixel classified hdf5 files - file location is specified in seg_user_param.py.
    
    Output: Datasets added to the sub-volume input files - one dataset per each class/label in trained data.
